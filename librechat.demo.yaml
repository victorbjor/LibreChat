      # Terms and Conditions for the New Agents Platform

      *Effective Date: December 2024*

      **Security Classification: UNCLASSIFIED / NON-EXPORT CONTROLLED**

      ## 🚨 IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER 🚨

      **This is a DEVELOPMENT/DEMO platform.** It's like a sandbox, but with more bugs and fewer castles. Use at your own risk, and please don't blame us if your AI agent decides to go rogue and start composing haikus about your lunch.

      ## 1. What This Is (And Isn't)

      This is a development and demonstration platform for testing AI agents, workflows, and various digital shenanigans. It's NOT a production system, it's NOT secure for sensitive data, and it's definitely NOT your grandmother's knitting website. 

      ## 2. Who Should Be Here

      - Developers (the brave souls who write code)
      - Invited guests (you know who you are)
      - Curious onlookers (welcome to the show!)

      ## 3. What We Collect (The Not-So-Scary Stuff)

      Before release 1 (yes, that is now), we will be collecting pretty much everything you do here. So do not expect any privacy, or ability to delete your data.
      
      ## 4. The "Please Don't" Section

      - Don't upload classified information (this platform is literally marked UNCLASSIFIED)
      - Don't try to break things on purpose (though accidental breakage is part of the fun)
      - Don't expect 99.9% uptime (we're aiming for "mostly functional")
      - Don't be surprised if features appear, disappear, or mutate overnight

      ## 5. The "What Could Go Wrong" Section

      - Things might break (it's a dev platform, after all)
      - Data might get lost (backup your important stuff elsewhere)
      - Features might change without warning (surprise!)
      - Your AI agent might develop a personality (we're not responsible for existential crises)

      ## 6. Contact Information

      If something goes terribly wrong or you have questions, reach out to the development team. You know who we are. If not, you are up for some nice detective work!

      ## 7. The Fine Print

      By using this platform, you acknowledge that:
      - This is a development environment
      - Things might not work as expected
      - You're using it at your own risk
      - You won't sue us if your AI agent starts speaking in tongues
      - The AI might be a bit psycophantic, but it does not love you for real. It is a robot.

      **Remember: This is a sandbox for developers, not a production system. Have fun, experiment, and please report bugs instead of just cursing at your screen.**
